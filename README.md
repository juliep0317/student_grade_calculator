# Student Grade Calculator Project
## Create a Python script that calculates a student's grade based on their test scores and demonstrates the use of various operators.

### This project demonstrates the following concepts:
- List operators: The scores list is created to store the student's test scores.
- Floor division: The  //  operator is used to calculate the average score.
- Comparison operators: The  =  and  <  operators are used to determine the grade based on the average score.
- Assignment operators: The  +=  operator is used to update the grade with a "+" if the average score's last digit is greater than or equal to 5.
- Membership operators: The in operator is used to check if a specific score exists in the list of scores.
- Identity operators: The is operator is used to compare if scores and scores_copy are the same object.
- Bitwise operators: The & operator is used to perform a bitwise AND operation on the first two scores.

I found this project helped me practise the different type of operators and it was interesting to see how the student's grade 
would change depending on the student's score average.
